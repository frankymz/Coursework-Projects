1, 1, 2, 5, 8, 4, -11, -17, 35, 152, 161, -254, -968, -575, 2813, 7049, 1394, -24047,
 -45260, 15472

Using the first 4 terms you get the first equation:
z + y + 2x = 5
1   1   2    5
Terms 2-5 second equation:
z + 2y + 5x = 8
Then the third with terms 3-6:
2z + 5y + 8z = 4

A simple calculator will give the values:
x = 3
y = -6
z = 5

These will be used as the coefficients
